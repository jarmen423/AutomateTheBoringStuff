        "The heart of these tutorials is to learn basic programming concepts that can be transfered to other programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can compute expressions with a calculator or enter string concatenations with a word processor. You can even do string replication easily by copying and pasting text. But expressions, and their component values—operators, variables, and function calls—are the basic building blocks that make programs. Once you know how to handle these elements, you will be able to instruct Python to operate on large amounts of data for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is good to remember the different types of operators (`+`, `-`, `\\*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, and `**` for math operations, and `+` and `*` for string operations) and the three data types (integers, floating-point numbers, and strings) introduced in this chapter.\n",
        "\n",
        "I introduced a few different functions as well. The `print()` and `input()` functions handle simple text output (to the screen) and input (from the keyboard). The `len()` function takes a string and evaluates to an int of the number of characters in the string. The `str()`, `int()`, and `float()` functions will evaluate to the string, integer, or floating-point number form of the value they are passed."

        "* __Value__: The information that is stored within a certain object.\n",

        "\n",

        "* __Integer__: These are 'whole numbers' such as 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "* __Rational number___: These are real numbers that can be expressed as a quotient or fraction of two integers (e.g., 0/1, 1/1, -1/1, 1/2, -3/4, etc.). Informally speaking, these are numbers with a finite decimal represention or with a pattern (0.3, 0.41, -4.4532, 4.99999..., 3.14, etc.).\n",

        "* __Irrational number__: These are real numbers that are not rational numbers (e.g., pi, exp, the golden ratio, sqrt(2), etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "* __Floating point number__: Computers use decimal represenations of real numbers. Important: computers can only provide 15-16 digits of a real numbers. These representations are called floating point numbers. Floating point numbers do not form a field (i.e., binary operations are not associative with floating point numbers).\n",
        "\n",
        "* __Associative property__: A property that states that binary operations do not change regardless of grouping (e.g., (2+3)+4=2+(3+4)). Important: binary operations, like addition and subtraction, on floating point numbers are not associative on computers (e.g., `(exp(2*pi)+exp(pi))-exp(1)` and `exp(2*pi)+(exp(pi)-exp(1))` are mathematically the same, but not so with Python). Unlike mathematics, associativity is not always guarenteed on computers.\n",
