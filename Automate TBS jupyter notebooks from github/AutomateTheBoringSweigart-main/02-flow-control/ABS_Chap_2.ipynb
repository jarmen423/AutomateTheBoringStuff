        "# Summary\n",
        "By using expressions that evaluate to `True` or `False` (also called conditions), you can write programs that make decisions on what code to execute and what code to skip. You can also execute code over and over again in a loop while a certain condition evaluates to True. The break and continue statements are useful if you need to exit a loop or jump back to the loopâ€™s start.\n",
        "\n",
        "These flow control statements will let you write more intelligent programs. You can also use another type of flow control by writing your own functions, which is the topic of the next chapter."

        "\n",
        "* __Comparison operators__: Compares two expressions and evaluates them down to a single Boolean value: either `True` or `False`. E.g., `True==True`, `0<5`, `5=!4`, `6<=6`, `9>=2` all evaluate down to the Boolean value `True`.\n",

For example, the `and` and `or` operators always take two Boolean values (or expressions) and maps them to either `True` or `False`. The `and` operator evaluates an expression to `True` if both Boolean values are `True` or both are `False`; otherwise, it evaluates to `False`. \n",
