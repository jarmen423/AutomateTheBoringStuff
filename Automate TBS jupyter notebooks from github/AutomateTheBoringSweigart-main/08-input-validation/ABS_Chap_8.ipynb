        "# Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s easy to forget to write input validation code, but without it, your programs will almost certainly have bugs. The values you expect users to enter and the values they actually enter can be completely different, and your programs need to be robust enough to handle these exceptional cases. You can use regular expressions to create your own input validation code, but for common cases, it’s easier to use an existing module, such as `PyInputPlus`. You can import the module with `import pyinputplus as pyip` so that you can enter a shorter name when calling the module’s functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "PyInputPlus has functions for entering a variety of input, including strings, numbers, dates, yes/no, True/False, emails, and files. While `input()` always returns a string, these functions return the value in an appropriate data type. The `inputChoice()` function allow you to select one of several pre-selected options, while `inputMenu()` also adds numbers or letters for quick selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "All of these functions have the following standard features: stripping whitespace from the sides, setting timeout and retry limits with the timeout and limit keyword arguments, and passing lists of regular expression strings to `allowRegexes` or `blockRegexes` to include or exclude particular responses. You'll no longer need to write your own tedious while loops that check for valid input and reprompt the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "If none of the PyInputPlus module’s, functions fit your needs, but you’d still like the other features that PyInputPlus provides, you can call `inputCustom()` and pass your own custom validation function for PyInputPlus to use. The documentation at https://pyinputplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ has a complete listing of PyInputPlus’s functions and additional features. There’s far more in the PyInputPlus online documentation than what was described in this chapter. There’s no use in reinventing the wheel, and learning to use this module will save you from having to write and debug code for yourself.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that you have expertise manipulating and validating text, it’s time to learn how to read from and write to files on your computer’s hard drive."
