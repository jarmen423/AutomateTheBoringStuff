        "Files are organized into folders (also called directories), and a path describes the location of a file. Every program running on your computer has a current working directory, which allows you to specify file paths relative to the current location instead of always typing the full (or absolute) path. The `pathlib` and `os.path` modules have many functions for manipulating file paths.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Your programs can also directly interact with the contents of text files. The `open()` function can open these files to read in their contents as one large string (with the `read()` method) or as a list of strings (with the `readlines()` method). The `open()` function can open files in write or append mode to create new text files or add to existing text files, respectively.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In previous chapters, you used the clipboard as a way of getting large amounts of text into a program, rather than typing it all in. Now you can have your programs read files directly from the hard drive, which is a big improvement, since files are much less volatile than the clipboard."
